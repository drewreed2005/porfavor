                        Welcome to Drew's Python Lounge.
                        This is a private server on which Drew will keep his (as well as his group members') work.
                        This is a great place to test out ideas for potential HTML and CSS code.
                        And Python. Obviously.
                        Welcome in! You must be pretty special if you somehow got here.

                        My Fastpages includes blog posts in which I go over much of my progress and learnings from AP Computer Science Principles.

                        Certain programs you'll find on here have further documentation on there.

                        I'm working with "The Watchers" (Me, Devon Shepherd, Trent Cardall, and Jagger Klein) to make the "Work Watch."
                        It's a program that keeps track of how long you've been working to let you know when you should take breaks.
                        It also gives suggestions on things to do during your break.
